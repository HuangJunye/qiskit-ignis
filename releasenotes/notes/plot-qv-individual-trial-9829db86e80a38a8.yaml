    Add :meth:`qiskit.ignis.verification.quantum_volume.QVFitter.plot_qv_trial` for plotting individual trails leveraging on :meth:`qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram` from Qiskit Terra.
    * Ideal and experimental values are plotted in an overlapping way as suggested by David McKay.
    * Experimental heavy output probability are shown on the legend.
    * Median probability is plotted as red dashed line.
    * Use figsize kwarg to control figure size. It's useful for showing results for larger QV circuits.
