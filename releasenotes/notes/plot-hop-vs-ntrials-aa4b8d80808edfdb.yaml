    Add :meth:`qiskit.ignis.verification.quantum_volume.QVFitter.plot_hop_accumulative` for plotting heavy output probability (HOP) vs number of trials similar to Figure 2a of QV64 paper (arXiv:2008.08571).
    * HOP of individual trials are plotted as scatters.
    * Cummulative HOP are plotted in red line.
    * Two-sigma confidence intervals are plotted as shaded area.
    * 2/3 success threshold is plotted as dashed line.
